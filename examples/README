There are two files here:

  example.schema

You can feed this into the sqldef.pl program, and pipe the output to mSQL,
as in:

  sqldef.pl example.schema | msql rdbms

Make sure you created the rdbms database, and that you have read/write
access to it. Also, make sure rdbms doesn't have anything important in it!

If you'd rather create the same databases, but put lots of data into them,
you could try:

  msql rdbms < example.sql

If you'd like to try the example, put example.cgi somewhere under your web
server, like your home directory. Make sure that .cgi programs are
executable under your web server, or you can put this in a cgi-bin
directory. Please see your web server docs for more info. Check to make
sure the #! notation at the top of example.cgi points to the correct perl
interpreter, and load it up in your web browser with a URL like:

  http://localhost/cgi-bin/example.cgi?db=rdbms

This assumes you copied it to your cgi-bin directory, and that the database
you are using, as in the previous two examples in this README, is named
rdbms.

Have fun,
